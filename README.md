# Jstris Tutor Maker

Helps you make a Jstris usermode for placing a queue of pieces in the right spots.

## How to use:

<ol>
<li>Replace the contents of <code>BlockQueue</code> with the piece queue that should be used, including an H before every piece that should be held</li>

<li>Set <code>HowManyBlocks</code> to the number of pieces that the player should place. This number must be at least 1 less than the size of <code>BlockQueue</code>.</li>

<li>Go to <a href="https://jstris.jezevec10.com/usermodes/create">https://jstris.jezevec10.com/usermodes/create</a> and wait until it no longer says <i>Generating X/Y components</i></li>

<li>Fill in the pieces, starting with piece 1. Once you save piece 1, it copies the content to piece 2 and so on so you only need to draw the next piece each time.</li>
</ol>
